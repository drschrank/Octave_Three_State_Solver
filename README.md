This code is orginally written in MATLAB. I'm in the process of updating and preparing it for use in Octave. Currently the following are confirmed to work:
-multinomialthresholddist.m
-multithreshdistllikelihood.m
-multithreshsolver.m

Other functions and scripts are in various states of testing and update for use in Octave. Various lines of code have been commented out that are not compatible with Octave. They have been marked for (hopefully) ease of reimplemantation if used with MATLAB.
